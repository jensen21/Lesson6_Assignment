Questions:

1.  Name two methods you can use to add a node to the DOM tree, and explain the difference between them.

insertBefore()
appendChild()

When a node is added using the appendChild() method then the node is always appended after any child node that already exists. Whereas, the insertBefore() method allows one to specify the order of the inserted node from its sibling nodes.   


2.  List the six main objects that make up the browser object model. 

The six main objects that make up the browser object model are window object, navigator object, history, location object and the document object.
